This repository houses code written according to freecodecamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) certification's "Learn Form Validation by Building a Calorie Counter" course

The goal of the course was to learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results and gain knowledge of basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
