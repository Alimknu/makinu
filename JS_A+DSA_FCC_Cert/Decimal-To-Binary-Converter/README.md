This repository houses code written according to freecodecamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) certification's "Learn Recursion by Building a Decimal to Binary Converter" course

The goal of the course was to build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript, learning the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.
