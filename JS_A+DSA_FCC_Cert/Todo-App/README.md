This repository houses code written according to freecodecamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) certification's "Learn localStorage by Building a Todo App" course

The goal of the course was to learn about the local storage web browser feature and learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.
